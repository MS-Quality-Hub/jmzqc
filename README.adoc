//This project is a parser, validator and normalizer implementation for shorthand lipid nomenclatures, base on the https://github.com/lifs-tools/goslin[Grammar of Succinct Lipid Nomenclatures project].

//Goslin defines multiple grammers compatible with https://www.antlr.org/[ANTLRv4] for different sources of shorthand lipid nomenclature. This allows to generate parsers based on the defined grammars,
//which provide immediate feedback whether a processed lipid shorthand notation string is compliant with a particular grammar, or not.

//jGoslin uses the Goslin grammars and the generated parser to support the following general tasks:

//. Facilitate the parsing of shorthand lipid names dialects.
//. Provide a structural representation of the shorthand lipid after parsing.
//. Use the structural representation to generate normalized names.

//The Maven site with JavaDoc is available https://lifs-tools.github.io/jmzqc/index.html[here].

== Building the project and generating client code from the command-line

In order to build the client code and run the unit tests, execute the following command from a terminal:

	./mvnw install

This generates the necessary domain specific code for Java. 

== Using the project code releases via GitHub Packages

Note: The library is currently not yet available from Github packages. Please check back later!

To use the parser libraries (reading and validation) in your own Maven projects, use the following dependency:

  <dependency>
    <groupId>org.lifstools</groupId>
    <artifactId>jmzqc</artifactId>
    <version>${jmzqc.version}</version>
  </dependency>

where `jmzqc.version` is the version of jmzqc you wish to use, e.g. for a release version:

  <properties>
    <jmzqc.version>1.0.0</jmzqc.version>
  </properties>

as defined in the properties section of your pom file.

== Using the API programmatically

=== Reading MzQC JSON into the object model

To parse a JSON string directly:

  Coordinate c = Converter.fromJsonString(....);

Alternatively, to read the content from a file:

  Coordinate c = Converter.fromFile(new File("path/to/file.mzQC"));

Or, to read from a URL:

  Coordinate c = Converter.fromUrl(new Url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HUPO-PSI/mzQC/master/doc/examples/QC2-sample-example.mzQC"));
  
You can then access the MzQC object:

  MzQC mzQc = c.getMzQC();

Write support coming soon!
